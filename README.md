# Customer-Churn-Prediction
In this repository you can find:
- the notebook with the code
- the dataset used that come from Kaggle
- a pdf file that summarises the project result

My group tried to solve a customer churn prediction problem by using a bank dataset found in Kaggle.

After the EDA and the data preprocessing, we developed different models to achieve the best binary classification result.

We also created a Neural Network by using the Keras library.
